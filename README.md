## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Since the appearance of home computers in the 1970s, computers have become the basic configuration for more and more families, individuals and companies. The rapid development of semiconductor hardware with its smaller and smaller sizes and stronger computing power also promoted computers to become an indispensable part of personal work, life and entertainment. At present, laptops have become one of the most popular electronic devices because of their lightness and efficiency.

Because of the increasing demand for laptop computers, there are many products on the market, with various models and configurations, which makes choosing a laptop that suits you a little complicated. Even an expert of the laptop will find it is hard to give a recommendation to people, for it is a very customized question. Is there a way to make people who do not have professional knowledge choose a computer that suits them? This is exactly what we hope this system can solve, which will save people a lot of time and money.

This project brings to users a light, elegant and efficient laptop recommendation application on Android devices. It only requires the users to answer 3-5 simple questions like what they would use the laptop for to get users’ preference. After inquiring about our rule based system, the app will feedback the users with many recommendations of laptops with details of model, specs, price and image. Users will get their recommendation in minutes, which meets people’s demand perfectly and saves a lot of time from collecting all the knowledge and information by themselves.
